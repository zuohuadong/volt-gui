# Changelog

All notable changes to the Go line (Reasonix 1.0+) are recorded here. The legacy
`0.x` TypeScript history lives on the [`v1`](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/tree/v1)
branch.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Goal is now the sole long-task runtime. Historical AutoResearch sidecars
  migrate transactionally into research-budget Goals. Invalid archives block
  fail closed and remain read-only; successful Goal-only sidecars omit the old
  task id and write an explicit downgrade fence so previous readers cannot
  reactivate the removed runtime.

- **Issue #7575:** Linux Bash under bubblewrap no longer mounts a fresh empty
  `--tmpfs /tmp` on every call. Consecutive commands in the same logical session
  now share a private temporary directory (bound at `/tmp` on Linux, exported via
  `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP` on all platforms) without exposing the host public
  temporary root. `/new`, `/clear`, resume of another session, and branch
  switches rotate the directory; model/settings hot rebuilds keep it. Sub-agent
  runs get independent directories. Temporary files are not durable across process
  restarts.

### Added

- Added `[ui].show_turn_usage` so CLI/TUI users can hide per-request token and
  cost receipts from transcript scrollback without disabling usage accounting.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-08-05

Extension kernel, Task Monitor, and safer Goal completion.

Compact decision surfaces, local decision receipts, unified extension kernel,
native Task Monitor, bounded sub-agent progress, Goal fail-closed completion,
MiMo and DashScope Responses fixes, SSH remote access simplification, and
multiple Desktop stability improvements.

### Highlights

- **Unified Extension Kernel and Extension Protocol v1**: Immutable runtime
  snapshots, fail-atomic reload, Plugin Manifest v1 (prompts, themes, full-trust
  code runtimes), stable JSON-RPC sidecar protocol, interceptor dispatch,
  streaming provider adapter, structured UI, and Go SDK.
- **Native Task Monitor**: Monitor agent tasks natively in CLI and Desktop with
  lifecycle semantics and session-scoped summary view.
- **Bounded Sub-agent Progress Forwarding**: Forward structured progress for
  `task`, `parallel_tasks`, and `fleet` without flooding the parent stream.
  Renders nested lifecycle cards in Desktop and stable per-child transcript
  slots in CLI.
- **Goal Completion Fail-Closed**: Replace free-form Goal footer markers with a
  stable `update_goal` tool and epoch-scoped per-turn reports. Centralized
  completion logic with bounded evaluator, progress-aware budgets, and
  pause/resume controls.
- **Ablation Subsystem Switches**: Switch subsystems off behind one shared
  vocabulary for controlled experiments. Includes planner, subagent, retrieval,
  evidence, and compaction.
- **Benchmark Cost per Solved Task**: Report cost per solved task, tokens per
  solved, median wall time, and failure-class breakdown in e2e reports.
- **Compact Decision Surfaces and Local Receipts**: Compact footer decision-card
  layout with bounded scroll, dense action rows, and overflow disclosure.
  Record bounded Ask, approval, and recovery decisions as local transcript
  receipts.
- **Simplified SSH Remote Access**: Remove Remote Workbench protocol and
  stacks; reuse CLI/Serve remote model. Desktop opens per-host native web child
  windows via SSH. Keyless remote Serve setup with loopback-only page.
- **Model Usage Charts with Primer Palette**: Replace monochrome accent ramp
  with GitHub Primer data-viz two-set categorical palette. Fix donut overflow
  on hover and keyboard accessibility.
- **Cross-platform Extension and Task Monitor Reliability**: Make
  content-reference eviction deterministic, reject Unix and Windows absolute
  plugin paths consistently, stabilize parallel-task cancellation, and restore
  reliable Windows validation for Task Monitor and remote provider setup.
- **MiMo and DashScope Responses Wire Alignment**: Fix multi-turn tool loops,
  reasoning round-trip, JSON output for MiMo; fix DashScope second-turn 400
  error, all-zero usage suppression, and vendor-aware cache TTL.
- **Desktop Stability Fixes**: Recover stuck updates and legacy WebKit, contain
  macOS alias repair startup crashes, keep composer overflow stacks readable,
  and harden account verification and community flows.
- **Remote Web Recovery After SSH Drops**: Add integration regression test for
  SSH drop, forward recovery, and window reload. Document transient outage
  behavior.
- **CI: Auto-minimize Activity-Farming Spam Comments**: Detect and minimize
  template spam comments from non-contributor accounts based on structural
  signals.

### Added

- Added Extension Protocol v1 and the unified extension kernel: installed or
  linked sidecars can contribute tools, skills, commands, hooks, MCP servers,
  providers, interceptors, and structured UI surfaces through a versioned
  NDJSON contract and the public Go SDK. CLI, Desktop, ACP, and Serve support
  fail-atomic runtime reloads; Serve also renders extension surfaces and lists
  extension-hosted providers without exposing credentials.
- Added the structured Goal completion protocol: the always-registered
  `update_goal` tool (continue/complete/blocked with reason and next_action)
  replaces the `[goal:*]` footer markers. The Goal FSM is now the exclusive
  cross-turn decision point and validates every complete claim against Delivery
  readiness; when the model submits no report, an independent bounded evaluator
  (recovery_model → guardian_model → main model, no tools/history, usage
  attributed to `goal-evaluator`) judges the turn once, and any evaluator
  failure pauses the goal instead of continuing silently.
- Added Goal budget classes with safe pauses: simple 10 turns / 200k tokens,
  write 20 turns / 400k tokens, AutoResearch 40 turns / 800k tokens, and a
  4-turn no-host-verifiable-progress gate. Pauses keep all Goal state; `/goal
  resume` continues and adds one slice of the current class when the pause was
  budget-related. `/goal status` shows the full turn/token/no-progress runtime,
  and `/goal pause` manually suspends a running Goal.
- Added the `goalRuntime` nested view to the desktop Meta, the remote protocol
  (`session/goal/pause` operation, `goalRuntime` DTO on session meta), and the
  ACP status payload; the desktop Composer goal menu shows the runtime summary
  with distinct pause/end/resume actions.

### Changed

- Delivery no longer retries final-answer readiness with hidden model messages:
  a plain Delivery run ends on the first unsatisfied final answer and surfaces
  the recovery card, while a Goal + Delivery run has the Goal FSM absorb the
  failure and continue under budget with the missing requirements as the next
  turn's prompt. Historical `[goal:*]` footers are stripped from old transcripts
  for display only and never participate in state decisions.
- Added a **Remote SSH** module (VS Code Remote-SSH style): a user-global
  `[remote]` host config, `reasonix remote` CLI (add/list/remove/import/test/
  connect/status/forward/serve/fs) and `/remote` slash command, an SSH transport
  with trust-on-first-use host-key verification, keepalive + exponential-backoff
  reconnect, `-L`/`-R` port forwarding, and SFTP file access. `connect`
  bootstraps a persistent `reasonix serve` on the remote host and tunnels its
  loopback port so the full agent runs remotely. The desktop app adds a
  **Settings -> Remote SSH** host manager, a remote file browser/editor, a
  port-forwarding panel, and a status-bar connection chip. Linux/macOS remotes.
- Added `reasonix serve --port-file/--token-file/--pid-file` so a supervised
  headless serve can bind an ephemeral port and read its auth token from a file
  (keeping it out of `ps`).
- Added an authenticated, loopback-only Provider setup page for `reasonix
  serve`. A Serve whose selected Provider is missing its API key now remains
  reachable, stores the submitted key in that host's Reasonix credential file,
  and rebuilds the active controller in place without restarting Serve.
- Added Claude Code-style searchable CLI pickers for models, providers, and
  sessions, with arrow, Vim, and `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+N` navigation.
- Added `-p` / `--print`, `text`, `json`, and `stream-json` output modes for
  one-shot use and automation.
- Added session-scoped `--allowed-tools`, repeatable `--add-dir`, Claude-compatible
  permission modes, flexible `--resume [QUERY]`, and the `--copy` resume escape
  hatch.
- Added `/status` details for the active model, effort, cache, Git state,
  background jobs, work profile, and provider balance where available.
- Remote SSH workspaces now open as a standalone remote web window again.
  Opening a workspace from the status bar or the Remote Server tab starts or
  reuses the remote `reasonix serve`, tunnels its loopback port, and opens the
  Serve web client in a dedicated per-host window. The remote web page uses
  the provider configuration and API keys on the **remote** host; the desktop
  no longer exposes its local providers to remote hosts. If the selected remote
  Provider is missing its API key, the window opens a setup page that saves the
  key only on that host and then opens the normal Serve UI. The Remote Workbench
  protocol, its Provider Broker, and the same-window remote projection were
  removed. Legacy mirror and provider-trust files are not deleted
  automatically; Settings -> Remote SSH shows a cleanup card when they exist.
  The hidden `remote attach-workspace`, `remote runtime-workbench`, and
  `remote workbench-build-id` commands now fail with a pointer to
  `reasonix remote connect <host> --open`.
- Automatic Plan Mode has been retired. Plan Mode is now always entered through
  an explicit user choice, and the one-time config v5 upgrade removes legacy
  `agent.auto_plan` and `agent.auto_plan_classifier` values so upgraded users
  receive the same behavior as new users.
- `Shift+Tab` now cycles CLI safe modes from Ask to Auto to Plan, while YOLO
  remains an independent `Ctrl+Y` toggle.
- Model, provider, resume, and approval menus now use consistent row selection;
  slash completion, help, aliases, and dispatch share one command registry.
- The full-screen CLI composer now uses theme-accented borders and a slim bar
  cursor by default, grows within the available terminal height, scrolls long
  drafts independently, and preserves selections across explicit image paste.
- The persistent CLI footer now uses a responsive, theme-aware layout for
  interaction state, model, effort, localized work mode, Git identity, cache,
  context, compaction headroom, jobs, and balance. Narrow terminals move or
  compact complete groups instead of clipping labels.
- CLI clipboard actions now separate terminal-native text paste from explicit
  image paste: `Ctrl+V` on macOS/Linux, `Alt+V` on Windows, or `/paste-image`.
  Local transcript copy verifies the native clipboard write, while SSH uses a
  clearly labelled OSC 52 fallback.
- Runtime rebuilds after model, effort, or work-mode changes now preserve the
  conversation, session permission overrides, additional directories, and
  session lease ownership.
- Agent execution now monitors host-observed Todo progress automatically. A
  stalled current item receives a recovery nudge after 8 tool-call rounds with
  no new completion, unique read, command, or mutation, and pauses with saved
  work after 16. Exact repeats do not renew the progress lease; real work does.
  Two-level task lists keep the single in_progress contract: the active
  sub-step is the only current item while its phase stays pending, and the
  phase becomes in_progress to sign off only after all of its sub-steps are
  completed. A level-1 sub-step with no phase header above it is rejected.
  Executor and planner rounds now use automatic progress management. Retired
  `[agent].max_steps` and `planner_max_steps` keys remain parseable for upgrades,
  but are ignored and removed by a one-time migration so stale hidden limits
  cannot truncate new behavior. One-off CLI and unattended bot limits remain.

### Fixed

- Fixed long parallel sub-agent research being silently lost when combined
  `parallel_tasks` or `fleet` answers exceeded the single-tool output limit.
  Persisted sessions now keep each child transcript independently, return a
  bounded fair preview plus stable reference for every result, and page full
  answers through the conversation-scoped `read_subagent_result` tool.
- Fixed Remote Workbench failing with only `initialize: workbench-desktop:
  connection closed` on fresh or cross-platform SSH hosts. Desktop now proves
  the exact Host CLI Build ID, provisions the matching verified release without
  requiring remote npm, runs the managed binary explicitly, and preserves a
  safe structured bootstrap error when the remote command exits early.
- Hardened Bash permission reuse for dynamic and indirect execution. Parameter/arithmetic expansions,
  assignments, redirects, heredocs, and globs can only be remembered as exact
  `Bash=<literal>` rules, while still using Auto's normal fallback. Nested or
  indirect execution now requires a human in interactive Ask/Auto and fails
  closed in headless Ask/Auto/DontAsk. Broad Bash rules, Guardian/hook allows,
  and the approved-plan window can no longer silently authorize that stricter
  class; YOLO remains the explicit full-access bypass and sandbox enforcement
  is unchanged.
- Fixed Desktop sessions incorrectly locking themselves during Goal + Delivery
  mode changes, controller rebuilds, duplicate-tab restore, and background
  reattachment. Desktop now keeps one process-local runtime owner per canonical
  session, fences stale controller events by runtime epoch, blocks sends until
  that runtime is ready, and scopes single-instance ownership to
  `REASONIX_HOME` instead of the executable path. Switching saved sessions is
  now transactional: a target build, restore, or lease failure leaves the
  current controller, lease, path, mode profile, and runtime epoch untouched.
- Stabilized the desktop rich composer caret after skill and plugin invocation
  tags. DOM→model and model→DOM selection mapping now treat invocation chips as
  zero-length atoms while still counting user text that lands inside the NBSP
  caret anchor (common on Windows WebView2), restore both selection ends, and
  recover the insertion point from a `beforeinput` snapshot when the browser
  temporarily loses selection — so mid-text edits no longer jump to the end.
- Isolated the Windows desktop WebView2 shell from stale system proxies, so an
  exited proxy client cannot leave the embedded UI hidden during startup. If
  WebView2 still does not reach DOM-ready within 15 seconds, Reasonix now shows
  the native window with a recovery prompt instead of appearing not to launch.
  Remote Markdown images are fetched by the backend with Reasonix's proxy
  configuration instead of bypassing that proxy through the isolated WebView.
- Restored captured-mouse right-click text paste, made composer drag selection
  copy through the verified native clipboard path, and kept non-Git footer
  telemetry left-aligned without reserving an empty data band.
- Restored stateful MCP behavior after the v1.17.13 regression: user-added
  servers work without extra trust settings (including delivery-mode on-demand
  calls), repository-provided servers use one exact launch confirmation, and
  stdio tools reuse one persistent process so browser sessions survive across
  calls without repeated startup latency. The former trust/reverify/catalog
  management UI and CLI are removed.
- Localized persistent-footer labels and displayed work-mode values in English,
  Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese, while keeping command arguments
  stable.
- Restored the `0.53` content boundary: model output, tool output, session
  transcripts, recovery branches, and background-job artifacts retain their
  original text instead of being rewritten by heuristic secret redaction.
  Credential masking remains in key-entry summaries and explicit diagnostic or
  session-cleanup paths. Transcript-bearing session/job sidecars are kept
  private (`0600`, with private job directories), and the retired
  `redact_tool_output` setting is removed with a one-time upgrade notice.

## 1.1.0 – 1.19.7

Per-version entries for the intermediate releases are published in the
[bilingual release notes](https://reasonix.io/changelog/) and on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/releases).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-03

First stable release — a **ground-up rewrite in Go**. Not an upgrade of the `0.x`
TypeScript line; a new codebase that becomes the default (`main-v2`).

### Highlights

- **Go kernel**: a single static binary (CGO-free), cross-compiled for
  darwin/linux/windows on amd64 + arm64. Distributed via npm (the package wraps
  the native binary), Homebrew (`esengine/reasonix` tap), and release archives;
  no Node runtime needed to run it.
- **Agent core**: the loop, built-in tools (read/write/edit/multi_edit/glob/grep/
  ls/bash/web_fetch/todo_write), permission gate, sandboxed bash, and the
  DeepSeek prefix-cache–oriented design.
- **Subagents**: `task` plus explore/research/review/security_review skill agents.
- **Skills & hooks**: Claude-Code-style skills (`internal/skill`) and hooks
  (`internal/hook`), symlink-aware and slash-integrated.
- **MCP client**: connect external servers over stdio / Streamable HTTP; reads
  `[[plugins]]` and a Claude-Code `.mcp.json`.
- **Code intelligence via CodeGraph**: a tree-sitter symbol/call graph
  (`codegraph_*` tools) replaces embedding semantic search — no embedding service
  or API cost. Fetched into a local cache on first use (or `reasonix codegraph
  install`) and indexed in the background, so installs and startup stay fast.
- **Plan mode** with evidence-backed step sign-off (`complete_step`).
- **Memory**: `REASONIX.md` hierarchy + auto-memory, folded into the cache-stable
  prefix.
- **ACP** (`reasonix acp`) and an HTTP/SSE server frontend; desktop app (Wails).

### Fixed

- **File encoding support restored** — GBK/GB18030 (and other non-UTF-8) files
  can now be read, edited, and grepped correctly. The v2 rewrite had dropped
  v1's encoding detection; files in CJK Windows charsets were silently misread
  or rejected as binary. The read/edit/write round-trip now preserves the
  original file encoding. (#2637)

### Notes

- Versions: the legacy TypeScript line stays in `0.x`; the Go line starts at
  `1.0.0`. See [docs/MIGRATING.md](docs/MIGRATING.md).
- Release archives ship a bare binary; CodeGraph is fetched on first use. Windows
  support for the fetched runtime is unverified — install `codegraph` on PATH if
  the auto-fetch doesn't resolve there.
