# Configuration Paths

Starting with **Reasonix v1.8.1**, Reasonix uses one user-facing home directory
for global configuration and user-owned state. CLI and desktop share this
location.

## Reasonix Home

| Platform | Reasonix home |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/.reasonix` |
| Linux | `~/.reasonix` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\reasonix` |

Set `REASONIX_HOME` to override Reasonix home for tests, CI, or portable
installations. Normal users should not need it.

## What Lives There

| Data | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Global config | `<Reasonix home>/config.toml` |
| Global credentials file fallback | `<Reasonix home>/credentials` |
| Global slash commands | `<Reasonix home>/commands/` |
| Global skills | `<Reasonix home>/skills/` |
| Global hooks | `<Reasonix home>/settings.json` |
| Hook trust store | `<Reasonix home>/trust.json` |
| Sessions | `<Reasonix home>/sessions/` |
| Archives | `<Reasonix home>/archive/` |
| Memory | `<Reasonix home>/memory/` and `<Reasonix home>/projects/` |

Global credentials use `credentials_store = "auto"` by default. In auto mode,
Reasonix tries the OS credential store first and falls back to
`<Reasonix home>/credentials` when the keyring is unavailable. Set
`credentials_store = "keyring"` to require the OS credential store, or
`credentials_store = "file"` to always use the file fallback. `REASONIX_CREDENTIALS_STORE`
can override the mode for CI, tests, or portable installs.

New API keys saved by the setup wizard, the desktop app, or an interactive
missing-key prompt are written to the configured credential store above. Project
`.env` files are still loaded first for compatibility and deliberate per-project
overrides, but Reasonix does not write new keys into a project `.env`.

Caches remain in the OS cache directory, for example
`~/Library/Caches/reasonix` on macOS, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/reasonix` or
`~/.cache/reasonix` on Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\reasonix\cache` on Windows.
Set `REASONIX_CACHE_HOME` to override the cache root.

## Config Priority

Runtime configuration is resolved in this order:

```text
command-line flags
> project ./reasonix.toml
> global <Reasonix home>/config.toml
> compatible legacy global config
> built-in defaults
```

Writes always target the new global path:

```text
macOS/Linux: ~/.reasonix/config.toml
Windows:     %APPDATA%\reasonix\config.toml
```

## Legacy Migration

Starting with **v1.8.1**, Reasonix automatically checks legacy locations on
startup before the first config load. Migration is synchronous, one-time, and
non-destructive: old files are copied or converted to Reasonix home and left
untouched.

Legacy config sources include:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/reasonix/config.toml
~/.config/reasonix/config.toml
~/.reasonix/reasonix.toml
~/.reasonix/config.json
```

Legacy credentials and sessions are also imported into the configured credential
store / Reasonix home when the new destination does not already exist. If the
new global config already exists, it wins and legacy config files are only kept
as compatibility fallbacks.
