## Configuration

Resolution order: **flag > `./reasonix.toml` > the user config file >
built-in defaults**. Starting with **Reasonix v1.8.1**, the user config lives at
`~/.voltui/config.toml` on macOS/Linux and
`%AppData%\reasonix\config.toml` on Windows; see
[Configuration paths](./CONFIG_PATHS.md) for migration and related data paths.
Fields marked user/global only, including agent step limits, are not overridden
by `./reasonix.toml`.
Provider entries name secrets with `api_key_env`, while the secret values live in
Reasonix's global `<Reasonix home>/.env`, shared by CLI and desktop. Project
`.env`, home `.env`, inherited shell environment variables, legacy credentials,
and the OS keyring are not provider-key runtime fallbacks; legacy credentials are
only migration sources. Project `.env` still feeds workspace-scoped,
non-provider `${VAR}` expansion for MCP/plugin settings without importing
provider keys or Reasonix control variables. See
[Configuration paths](./CONFIG_PATHS.md) for the full `config.toml` and `.env`
structure.

For the desktop and CLI usage of visible reasoning language, see
[Reasoning language](./REASONING_LANGUAGE.md).

```toml
default_model = "deepseek-flash"   # executor; set [agent].planner_model to add a planner

```

For the full schema and every field's contract, see [`SPEC.md` §5](./SPEC.md#5-configuration-toml).

`[agent].plan_mode_allowed_tools` is an extra read-only declaration for custom or
external tools Reasonix cannot classify itself. For MCP/plugin tools, a concrete
model-visible name such as `mcp__github__issue_read` also promotes that tool to a
trusted read-only reader for planner and read-only research surfaces. Prefer the
one-time MCP read-only trust prompt, or plugin-level `trusted_read_only_tools`
when you want to pre-seed audited tools; keep `plan_mode_allowed_tools` as the
compatibility escape valve. It never unlocks known blocked plan-mode tools such
as `bash`, `task`, writers, installers, or memory mutation tools, and it never
bypasses bash's plan-mode safety checks.

### Environment variables

Most day-to-day settings belong in `config.toml` or the global Reasonix `.env`
described above. The variables below are process-level advanced switches; set
them before launching Reasonix. Project `.env` files are not a runtime source for
Reasonix control variables.

`REASONIX_MEMORY_COMPILER_LLM_CLASSIFICATION=true` enables the optional LLM
task/chat classifier for Memory v5. By default it is disabled, and Reasonix uses
the local heuristic classifier without extra provider calls. When enabled, cache
misses may send a small classifier request through the configured provider before
deciding whether a user input is task-like or conversational; this can add a
little latency, provider usage, and token cost. The classifier result is cached
per session for a short time. Only the exact trimmed value `true` enables it;
unset, `false`, `1`, and `TRUE` keep the default heuristic path.

```bash
REASONIX_MEMORY_COMPILER_LLM_CLASSIFICATION=true reasonix
```

For development runs, prefix the command that starts the process, for example:

```bash
REASONIX_MEMORY_COMPILER_LLM_CLASSIFICATION=true wails dev -forcebuild
```

Packaged desktop apps launched from the OS app launcher may not inherit variables
from your interactive terminal; start the app from an environment-managed launcher
when you intentionally want this advanced switch enabled.

## Serve web frontend

`reasonix serve` starts the same local engine behind a browser UI. Use it when
you want a desktop-style surface without installing the desktop app, when running
Reasonix on a remote development box through a tunnel, or when you want a
shareable view of a live session.

```bash
cd your-project
reasonix serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

By default it listens on `127.0.0.1:8787` with `auth_mode = "none"`. Keep that
default for local-only use. If you bind outside loopback, expose it through a
tunnel, or put it behind a reverse proxy, enable authentication before sharing
the URL:

```bash
reasonix serve --auth token
reasonix serve --addr 0.0.0.0:8787 --auth token
reasonix serve --auth password --password 'temporary-password'
```

Token mode prints a share URL with `?token=...`; pass `--token` or set
`[serve].token` to reuse a stable token. Password mode requires either
`--password` at startup or a stored bcrypt hash:

```bash
reasonix serve --hash-password --password 'strong-password'

# ~/.voltui/config.toml
[serve]
auth_mode = "password" # none|token|password
password_hash = "$2a$12$..."
behind_proxy = true    # only behind a trusted reverse proxy
```

The web UI exposes chat, tool approvals, session history, rewind/fork/summarize,
model and reasoning-effort controls, Goal, a live todo panel fed by the
`todo_write` tool, and provider balance when configured. Use `--model`,
`--max-steps`, or `--resume` for one-off launches; otherwise `serve` uses the
user-global `default_model`.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Shortcuts are documented by client because users usually look for the keys that
work in the surface they are using. The small mode rule is: `Shift+Tab` only
controls Plan, `Ctrl/Cmd+Y` only controls YOLO, and paste stays on the platform
paste key.

`[ui].shortcut_layout` is still accepted for old configs, but the shortcut
behavior below is unified across layouts.

### Desktop GUI

Desktop shortcuts are managed from **Settings → Shortcuts**. Pick a row, press a
new key combination, and Reasonix saves it for the desktop app. Conflicting
bindings are rejected so one shortcut never triggers two actions. Press `?` or
use the help button in the topic bar to open the shortcuts sheet; it is generated
from the same shortcut registry, so it reflects any custom bindings.

Global shortcuts:

| Key or control | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cmd+K` on macOS, `Ctrl+K` on Windows/Linux | Toggles the command palette | The palette focuses search when it opens; `Esc` closes it. |
| `Cmd+,` on macOS, `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux | Opens Settings | Use **Shortcuts** in Settings to customize desktop bindings. |
| `Cmd+W` on macOS, `Ctrl+W` on Windows/Linux | Closes the active top tab | The last tab is kept by the normal close-tab guard. |
| `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` | Shows or hides the left sidebar | Same action as clicking the sidebar toggle. |
| `Cmd+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+B` | Expands or collapses the most recent shell output | Same action as clicking the collapsed shell-output hint. |
| `Cmd+1`-`Cmd+9` on macOS, `Ctrl+1`-`Ctrl+9` elsewhere | Jumps to the matching visible chat in the sidebar | Hold `Cmd`/`Ctrl` briefly to reveal the numbered badges. Existing custom shortcuts that already use the same key take precedence. |
| `Cmd++`, `Cmd+-`, `Cmd+0` on macOS; `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0` elsewhere | Increases, decreases, or resets text size | `=` is accepted for the plus key on keyboards that report it that way. |
| `?` | Opens the keyboard shortcuts sheet | The sheet shows the current effective desktop bindings. |

Composer shortcuts:

| Key or control | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Sends the current message | IME composition confirmation is left alone. |
| `Shift+Enter` | Inserts a newline | The composer keeps focus. |
| `Shift+Tab` | Toggles Plan on/off | Plan is read-only planning and does not cycle Ask/Auto/YOLO. |
| `Cmd+Y` / `Ctrl+Y` | Toggles YOLO on/off | Turning YOLO off restores the previous Ask/Auto base when known. |
| `Cmd+V` on macOS, `Ctrl+V` on Windows/Linux | Pastes clipboard content | Clipboard images are attached; images can also be dropped into the composer. |
| Plain `Up` / `Down` at the prompt boundary | Recalls older or newer submitted prompts | Modified arrows and native text navigation stay with the textarea. |
| `Esc` while a turn is running | Cancels the running turn | If the turn has not produced a response yet, the draft is restored. |

Menus and controls:

| Key or control | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Up` / `Down` in slash, `@`, or past-chat menus | Moves the highlighted item | Past-chat search uses the same navigation keys. |
| `Enter` / `Tab` in those menus | Accepts the highlighted item | Directory-like entries can keep the menu open for the next level. |
| `Esc` in those menus | Closes the current menu or returns from past-chat search | Regular typing continues after the menu closes. |
| Ask / Auto / YOLO approval controls | Picks the tool approval posture directly | Clicking these controls is unchanged by keyboard shortcuts. |
| Tool approval card | `Left` / `Right`, `Enter`, `1`-`4`, `Esc` | Move the highlighted action, confirm it, pick a numbered action, or deny. The default highlighted action is Allow once. |
| Plan approval card | `Left` / `Right`, `Enter`, `1`-`3`, `Esc` | Move between Revise plan, Start execution, and Exit plan. The default highlighted action is Start execution. |
| Plan control | Toggles Plan on/off | Same mode as `Shift+Tab`. |
| Goal item in the collaboration menu | Starts, views, or clears Goal | Goal is not in any keyboard cycle. |

### CLI / TUI

Chat and transcript shortcuts:

| Key or command | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Sends the current message | While a turn is running, non-empty input is queued as follow-up feedback. |
| `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`, or `Ctrl+J` | Inserts a newline | Plain `Enter` is reserved for send/confirm. |
| Plain `Up` / `Down` while idle | Recalls older or newer submitted prompts | In a running turn, the same keys navigate queued follow-up feedback. |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Scrolls the transcript | Works regardless of the current chat state. |
| `Ctrl+Home` / `Ctrl+End` | Jumps to the top or bottom of the transcript | Useful after long tool output. |
| `Esc` | Backs out of the current action | It un-sends a just-submitted turn before any reply, cancels a running turn, or clears non-empty input. |
| Double `Esc` on an empty idle composer | Opens the rewind picker | Same entry point as `/rewind`. |
| Terminal native selection | Copies transcript text | Reasonix does not enable mouse reporting by default, so terminal selection/copy remains available. |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancels, clears, or quits | Cancels a running turn, clears non-empty input, or quits on a second empty-composer press. |
| `Ctrl+D` | Quits the TUI | Immediate quit. |
| `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Meta+V`, or `Super+V` | Pastes clipboard content | The CLI tries an image first, then falls back to text or file references. |
| `/paste-image` | Pastes a clipboard image | Use it when you want image-only paste or the terminal handles text paste itself. |
| A line starting with `!` | Runs a shell command directly | The command runs locally without asking the model. |

Mode and display shortcuts:

| Key or command | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Shift+Tab` | Toggles Plan on/off | Plan is read-only planning and does not cycle Ask/Auto/YOLO. |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Toggles YOLO on/off | Turning YOLO off restores the previous Ask/Auto base when known. Terminals that forward Command/Super may also send `Cmd+Y`, but `Ctrl+Y` is the reliable terminal shortcut. |
| `--yolo`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Starts chat in YOLO | Same runtime mode as `Ctrl+Y`. |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggles verbose reasoning display | Also available through `/verbose`. |
| `Ctrl+B` | Expands or collapses long shell output | Works with terminal-native text selection because the TUI does not enable mouse reporting by default. |
| Ask / Auto | No keyboard cycle | Ask is the default interactive base. Auto is not entered through `Shift+Tab`; use clients or APIs that expose the tool approval posture directly. |
| `/goal <objective>`, `/goal --research <objective>`, `/goal --simple <objective>`, `/goal status`, `/goal clear` | Starts, checks, or clears Goal | Goal is not in any keyboard cycle; clearly long-horizon goals automatically enable AutoResearch. Ordinary prompts with strong AutoResearch signals are also upgraded into Goal. |
| `/migrate`, `/migrate --from <legacy-dir>` | Retries legacy migration or imports sessions from a chosen v0.x source | Use `--from` for custom Windows v0.52 install/data directories; it imports sessions only. See [Configuration paths](./CONFIG_PATHS.md). |

Picker and approval shortcuts:

| Context | Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slash or `@` completion | `Up` / `Down`, `Tab` / `Enter`, `Esc` | Move, accept, or close the completion menu. |
| Tool approval prompt | `y`/`1`, `a`/`2`, `p`/`3`, `n`/`4`, `Enter`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` | Allow once, allow for session, persist allow, deny, accept default allow once, deny, or cancel the turn. |
| Ask question card | `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k`, `Left`/`Right` or `h`/`l`, `Space`, `Enter`, `1`-`9`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` | Navigate answers/tabs, toggle multi-select answers, submit/activate, pick numbered options, dismiss, or cancel the turn. |
| Rewind picker | `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k`, `Enter`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`, `s`, `u`, `Esc` | Choose a turn, apply both/conversation/code/fork/summarize actions, or go back/close. |
| Resume picker | `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k`, `Enter`, `Esc` | Choose a saved session or close the picker. |
| MCP import picker | `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k`, `Space`, `Enter`, `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` | Move, select servers, import selected servers, or cancel. |
| MCP manager | `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k`, `Enter`, `Left`/`Right` or `h`/`l`, `r`, number keys, `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Navigate server lists/details, refresh, choose actions, or close. |
| `/clear` confirmation | Arrow keys or `j`/`k` / `Tab`, `Enter`, `y`, `n`, `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` | Toggle Clear/Cancel, confirm clear, or cancel. |

Mode meanings:

| Mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Ask | Prompts for fallback writer approvals. |
| Auto | Auto-allows fallback approvals; explicit `ask` / `deny` rules still apply. |
| YOLO | Skips ordinary tool approval prompts; `deny`, user `ask` questions, plan approval prompts, and MCP read-only trust prompts still wait. |
| Plan | Keeps the next work read-only until a plan is approved or Plan is turned off. |
| Goal | Pursues a saved objective until complete, blocked, or cleared. |

## Permissions & sandbox

Permissions gate each tool call: `deny` > `ask` > `allow` > fallback. Bash and
file mutation tools require approval by default; read-only tools generally do
not. Approvals are stored and matched as permission rules, not button labels:
for example `Bash(npm run build)`, `Bash(npm run test:*)`, and `Edit(docs/**)`.
`reasonix` can grant Bash as an exact command or as a conservative command
prefix (for example `Bash(go test:*)`), while file-editing tools share session
edit grants and persist path-scoped rules such as `Edit(src/app.go)`.
`reasonix run` stays autonomous but still honours `deny`.

Permissions are *policy* (which calls to allow / prompt). The **sandbox** is
*enforcement*: the file-writers (`write_file` / `edit_file` / `multi_edit` / `move_file`)
refuse any path outside `[sandbox] workspace_root` (default: the current dir, so
edits stay in the project), resolving symlinks and `..` so a link can't tunnel
out. `forbid_read` optionally hides sensitive directories from the agent's
read/list/search tools; use absolute paths or `${HOME}` / `${VAR}` references,
not `~`, because config expansion is environment-variable based. `bash` is
itself jailed on macOS by default (`[sandbox] bash`, Seatbelt): commands may
write only those same roots (plus temp and toolchain caches), cannot read
configured `forbid_read` roots while the OS sandbox is active, and reach the
network only when `[sandbox] network` is set. Other platforms fall back to
running unconfined when no OS sandbox is available (see
[`SPEC.md` §9](./SPEC.md#9-roadmap-not-in-current-scope) for the escape-prompt and
Linux support still to come).

## Plugins (MCP)

Reasonix is an MCP client. A `[[plugins]]` entry's `type` selects the transport:
`stdio` (default) launches a local subprocess (`command`/`args`/`env`); `http`
(Streamable HTTP) connects to a remote `url` with optional static `headers`
(`${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` expanded from the environment, so tokens stay out
of the file). Tools surface to the model as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; a tool
declaring MCP's `readOnlyHint: true` joins parallel dispatch and the permission
reader-default, but planner / read-only research confirms third-party read-only
hints before relying on them. In interactive sessions, approve the first trust
prompt once, or choose the persistent option to remember the raw MCP tool name.
This trust prompt is a user decision, so Auto/YOLO tool approval does not answer
it; allowing for the session or persisting trust prevents repeat prompts for the
same MCP tool.
Advanced users can also pre-seed audited third-party readers on the plugin:

```toml
[[plugins]]
name = "github"
command = "github-mcp"
trusted_read_only_tools = ["issue_read", "pull_request_read"]
```

The desktop MCP panel keeps this as an advanced management surface: expand a
configured server and open its tools list, then use **Pre-trust read-only** or a
per-tool **Pre-trust** button only when you want to approve tools before they are
needed. Use **Untrust** to remove a remembered reader. The desktop writes the raw
MCP tool names to `trusted_read_only_tools` in the owning config source: project
`.mcp.json` servers are updated under
`mcpServers.<server>.trusted_read_only_tools`, while ordinary Reasonix plugins
are updated in the user's Reasonix config. Trust only side-effect-free readers;
create/update/delete tools should remain untrusted.

A server's **prompts** surface as `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` slash commands
(positional args after the command); its **resources** are pulled in by writing
`@<server>:<uri>` in a message; `/mcp` lists connected servers and what each
exposes. `make build` also produces `bin/reasonix-plugin-example` — a runnable
reference stdio server (`echo`, `wordcount`, a `review` prompt, a style-guide
resource) you can copy.

```toml
[[plugins]]                       # local stdio server
name    = "example"
command = "reasonix-plugin-example"
# call_timeout_seconds = 600       # optional per-server MCP call timeout
# tool_timeout_seconds = { "generate_video" = 1800 }   # optional raw MCP tool names

[[plugins]]                       # remote server over Streamable HTTP
name    = "stripe"
type    = "http"
url     = "https://mcp.stripe.com"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${STRIPE_KEY}" }
```

Enabled MCP servers start connecting automatically in the background after a
session begins, so chat stays usable while tools come online. Use `/mcp` or the
desktop MCP panel to refresh status, reconnect a server, inspect failures, or
disable a server for the current session.

**Already have an `.mcp.json`?** Drop it in the project root and Reasonix
reads it as-is — the `mcpServers` spec (`command`/`args`/`env`, `type`/`url`/
`headers`, `${VAR}` expansion) maps field-for-field onto `[[plugins]]`. Both
sources are merged; on a name collision `reasonix.toml` wins.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path"] },
    "stripe": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.stripe.com", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${STRIPE_KEY}" } }
  }
}
```

**Upgrading from `0.x`?** Your old `~/.voltui/config.json` is still read for its
`mcpServers` (honouring `mcpDisabled`) as a lowest-priority source, so MCP servers
keep working — move them into `reasonix.toml`'s `[[plugins]]` or a `.mcp.json` when
convenient.

## Slash commands

In an interactive `reasonix` session, built-in commands (`/compact`, `/new`, `/clear`, `/rewind`,
`/tree`, `/branch`, `/switch`, `/todo`, `/model`, `/mcp`, `/skills`, `/hooks`,
`/memory`, `/memory-v5`, `/goal`, `/output-style`, `/sandbox`, `/language`,
`/auto-plan`, `/reasoning-language`, `/help`) run
locally — `/help` lists them all. `/new` starts a new session while saving the
previous transcript for history/resume; `/clear` asks for confirmation, then
discards the current context without saving it. `/tree` shows saved conversation
branches, `/branch [name]` forks the current conversation tip, `/branch <turn>
[name]` forks from an earlier checkpointed turn, and `/switch <id|name>` loads
another branch. **Custom commands** are Markdown files under `.reasonix/commands/`
(project) or `~/.voltui/commands/` (user) — `review.md` becomes
`/review`, a subdirectory namespaces it (`git/commit.md` → `/git:commit`). The
body is a prompt template; invoking the command sends it as a turn.

`/memory` lists both memory documents (`REASONIX.md` / `AGENTS.md`) and saved
auto-memory facts. During agent turns, the read-only `history` and `memory`
tools let the model retrieve prior session decisions, compacted-history
archives, and saved facts on demand instead of injecting that dynamic state into
the stable system prompt. `/forget <name>` archives a saved fact rather than
deleting it permanently; the CLI/TUI and desktop memory panel can show those
archived files for traceability, but they are not searched as active memory.
Agent-initiated `remember` and `forget` calls always ask for fresh approval and
show a compact preview of the saved or archived memory before they run.
Retrieval keeps the top BM25 result while trimming weak common-word matches, and
0-result responses suggest narrower, more distinctive follow-up searches.
Memory v5 is enabled by default across the CLI/TUI, `reasonix serve`, and the
desktop app because they all share the same local controller. It records local,
project-scoped execution traces and compiler state under Reasonix home, then
compiles the next user turn into a compact execution contract only when prior
outcomes produce actionable constraints. Early turns may only write traces and
inject nothing. Memory v5 never bypasses memory approvals, never uploads memory
content, and never mutates the cache-stable system prompt, provider prefix, or
tool schemas.

Toggle future turns with `/memory-v5 off|on|status` inside an interactive
session, or with `reasonix config memory-v5 off|on|status` from a shell/script.
Desktop users can also use Settings → General → Memory v5. Settings → Updates →
Share aggregate quality metrics controls the optional aggregate upload. When
enabled, that upload may include only anonymous
count/size buckets such as injection on/off, compiled-token bucket, IR-overhead
bucket, memory-reference count, constraint/risk/step counts, and memory-graph
size buckets. It never includes memory text, prompts, tool outputs, file paths,
IDs, keys, base URLs, or file contents.

CLI/TUI and `reasonix serve` use the same user/global config. Project
`reasonix.toml` files cannot override this user/global setting. The CLI command
updates this underlying config; advanced users may also edit it manually under
Reasonix home:

```toml
[agent]
memory_compiler = { enabled = false }
```

The CLI can use Memory v5 for local turns, but it does not run the desktop
aggregate metrics upload pipeline. When `reasonix run --metrics <path>` is used,
the JSON also includes content-free `memory_compiler_*` summary fields and a
`memory_compiler_turn_details` array with per-turn injection state, compiled token
and IR-overhead estimates, referenced-memory/constraint/risk/step counts, and
current memory-graph counts.
For implementation details, see
[`SESSION_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL.md`](SESSION_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL.md).

```markdown
---
description: Review the staged diff
argument-hint: [focus-area]
---
Review the staged diff. Focus on $ARGUMENTS, list bugs with file:line.
```

`$ARGUMENTS` expands to all space-separated args, `$1`…`$N` to positional ones.
MCP prompts also appear here as `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>`.

## Goal and AutoResearch

Goal is the unified runtime for long-running objectives. Ordinary `/goal`
objectives stay lightweight: Reasonix keeps working until the goal is complete,
blocked, or cleared. When a goal is clearly long-horizon, Goal automatically
enables the AutoResearch strategy instead of requiring a separate
`/auto-research` skill; `auto-research` is not listed as a standalone built-in
skill in Settings -> Skills or the slash menu. If an ordinary chat prompt has a
very strong long-horizon signal, the host also upgrades it into the equivalent
of `/goal --research <original prompt>`.

AutoResearch is enabled for goals with strong signals such as "keep
researching", "long-running", "thoroughly", "debug until the root cause is
clear", "do not spin", "run experiments", "verify repeatedly", or "turn this
into a complete plan". It can also trigger when the objective combines multiple
phases such as research/diagnosis, implementation/fixing, verification/testing,
optimization/documentation/release, or when the user names an existing
`.reasonix/autoresearch/<task-id>/` directory. Advanced users can force it with
`/goal --research <objective>` or force lightweight Goal with
`/goal --simple <objective>`. Ordinary-chat auto-upgrade is more conservative
than `/goal`'s internal classification: standalone phrases such as "long term",
"optimize", "research this", or "verify this" do not create AutoResearch tasks
by themselves.

Once AutoResearch is active, the agent treats the goal as a stateful research
loop instead of a chat-only continuation. It creates or reuses a project-local
`.reasonix/autoresearch/<task-id>/` directory. For new tasks, the default id
shape is `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-slug`, such as `20260618-224530-cache-audit`; Reasonix
checks the project directory first and appends `-2`, `-3`, and so on only if
that id already exists. The task state includes `task_spec.md`, `progress.json`,
`findings.jsonl`, `directions_tried.json`, and `iteration_log.jsonl`, records
each iteration's direction, evidence, verification result, and blocker, and uses
`stale_count` to detect repeated weak progress. Repeated stalls force a
structural pivot, such as changing evidence source, entrypoint, test oracle,
decomposition, benchmark, or worker strategy, rather than retrying the same
tactic.

Workers and subagents may explore independently, but the orchestrator owns the
canonical state files. Completion requires a requirement-by-requirement evidence
audit against `task_spec.md`; a passing narrow check is not treated as proof of a
broad requirement. Dynamic run state stays in `.reasonix/autoresearch/...`, not
in `REASONIX.md`, `AGENTS.md`, project memory, tool schemas, or the cache-stable
system prompt. Public publishing, destructive operations, credentials, payments,
and external notifications still follow the normal approval, privacy, and cache
gates.

## @ references

Embed `@` references in a message and Reasonix resolves them before sending, as
tagged context blocks: `@path/to/file` (or `@dir`) injects a local file's
contents (or a directory listing), and `@<server>:<uri>` injects an MCP
resource. A local path is only treated as a reference when it actually exists,
so ordinary `@mentions` stay literal. Typing `/` or `@` opens an autocomplete
menu — slash commands, or hierarchical file navigation (one directory level at a
time, descend into folders) plus MCP resources.

## Two-model collaboration

`reasonix setup` keeps first-run minimal: pick provider → keys (every SKU of a
chosen provider is enabled). Running two models together (executor + planner,
separate cache-stable sessions) is a one-line edit afterwards — set
`planner_model` to any other enabled provider:

```toml
[agent]
planner_model = "deepseek-pro"   # used as the low-frequency planner
```

The planner sees loaded `REASONIX.md` / `AGENTS.md` memory and a small read-only
research tool set, so it can inspect relevant files before handing a plan to the
executor. Writer and workflow tools remain executor-only. `max_steps` limits the
executor; `planner_max_steps` limits only the planner, and either can be set to
`0` for no round limit.

Keep step-limit preferences in the user config. Project `./reasonix.toml` files
do not override `max_steps` or `planner_max_steps`.

Subagent skills inherit the executor model by default. Set `subagent_model` to
run them on another configured model, or use `subagent_models` to override only
specific skills such as `review` or `security_review`.

Use `read_only_task` when planning needs isolated, deeper research without
granting write-capable delegation. Use `read_only_skill` when the same need is
best expressed through an existing skill. Both run ephemeral read-only
subagents with only read-only research tools plus safe foreground bash, return
only the final answer, and do not create resumable subagent transcripts. In
token economy mode, connect only this narrow surface with
`connect_tool_source(source="read_only_skill")`; the full `skills` source still
enables writer-capable skill tools and remains blocked in plan mode.

For interactive frontends, plan mode is manual by default. Set
`agent.auto_plan = "on"` to make complex-looking tasks enter plan mode
automatically: Reasonix first drafts a read-only plan, then waits for approval
before editing or running side-effecting commands. `auto_plan_classifier` can
name a cheap provider such as `deepseek-flash`; it is only called for borderline
inputs and falls back to the heuristic if classification fails. Use
`/auto-plan off|on` inside `reasonix` to change the user-level setting, or
`reasonix config auto-plan off|on` from a shell/script. Auto-plan is user-level
only; `agent.auto_plan` in a project `reasonix.toml` is ignored. The visible
reasoning language uses a similar shape: `/reasoning-language auto|zh|en` in the
session, or `reasonix config reasoning-language auto|zh|en` in a shell/script.
Memory v5 uses `/memory-v5 off|on|status` or
`reasonix config memory-v5 off|on|status` and is user-level only. Pass `--local`
to the reasoning-language shell command only when you intentionally want a
project-local override.

The why behind separate sessions (keeping each model's prefix cache-stable) is in
[`SPEC.md` §3.5](./SPEC.md#35-two-model-collaboration-coordinator).
