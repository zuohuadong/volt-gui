# Migrating to Reasonix 1.0 (the Go rewrite)

Reasonix 1.0 is a **ground-up rewrite in Go**. It is a new codebase, not an
incremental upgrade of the `0.x` TypeScript releases. This guide explains what
changed and how to move over.

## TL;DR

| | Legacy (v1) | Reasonix 1.0+ (v2) |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript / Node | Go |
| Branch | [`v1`](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix/tree/v1) (maintenance only) | `main-v2` (default, active) |
| Versions | `0.x` (up to v0.54.x) | `1.0.0`+ |
| Install | `npm i -g reasonix@0.53.2` (pin a `0.x` version) | `npm i -g reasonix` — `latest` points at the current `1.x` stable; or a release archive / `go build` |
| Code intelligence | embedding semantic search + tree-sitter symbols | LSP-assisted code reading plus grep/read_file/glob; semantic index is not yet ported |

"v1" and "v2" are **codebase generations**, not semver: the v1 line never reached
1.0, so the Go rewrite takes the `1.x` major.

## Installing 1.0

`npm` stays the primary channel — the package wraps the prebuilt Go binary (the
same way esbuild/biome ship native binaries via npm). The binary itself is a
standalone Go executable; npm is only the installer, not a runtime dependency.

**`npm i -g reasonix` installs the current `1.x` stable.** npm's `latest` tag
moved to the Go line with `1.17.5` — the earlier "`latest` stays pinned to
`0.x`" migration guard silently downgraded `npm update -g` users once 1.x went
stable (#5822), so it was retired. Release candidates still ship under the
`next` tag; `0.x` stays installable by pinning:

```sh
npm i -g reasonix          # current 1.x stable
npm i -g reasonix@next     # release candidate, when one is ahead of stable
npm i -g reasonix@0.53.2   # pin the legacy TS build
```

Prebuilt archives (`reasonix-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` / `.zip`) and the desktop
installer are attached to each GitHub release. These are a **separate channel**
from npm: the installer drops a standalone desktop/binary build and does not
touch a CLI you installed with `npm i -g`, so the two coexist — an npm `0.53` in
your shell alongside a `1.x` desktop app is expected, not a conflict. Or build
from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix   # default: main-v2 (Go)
cd DeepSeek-Reasonix && make build                        # -> bin/reasonix(.exe)
```

## Configuration

| Legacy | Reasonix 1.0 |
|---|---|
| TS config files | `reasonix.toml` (project) / `config.toml` in Reasonix home (`~/.reasonix/` on macOS/Linux; `%AppData%\reasonix\` on Windows) from v1.8.1 — see `reasonix.example.toml` and [Configuration paths](./CONFIG_PATHS.md) |
| env / API keys | Provider config keeps `api_key_env`; saved key values live in Reasonix home `.env` (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `MIMO_API_KEY`, …) |
| project memory | `REASONIX.md` (+ auto-memory), Claude-Code-compatible |
| MCP servers | `[[plugins]]` in `reasonix.toml`, or a Claude-Code `.mcp.json` (read as-is) |

On first launch, v1.8.1+ runs a one-time, **non-destructive** import: it reads
legacy config from `~/Library/Application Support/reasonix/config.toml`,
`~/.config/reasonix/config.toml`, `~/.reasonix/reasonix.toml`, or v0.x
`~/.reasonix/config.json` (API key, base URL, language, MCP servers), migrates
legacy credentials into `<Reasonix home>/.env` when a key is missing there, and
imports past sessions from legacy session directories. Old files are left
untouched, and Reasonix prints a boot notice when it imports data. Each session lands in the
workspace it belonged to (read from its v0.x sidecar meta, summary carried over
as the title), so the desktop sidebar lists it under the right project; sessions
whose workspace no longer exists land in the global session dir. Imported
sessions resume with `--resume` or the history panel. The config import only
runs when no v1.8.1+ config exists yet — if v1.8.1+ wrote its config before your
legacy data was in place nothing is overwritten, so copy any missing values
across by hand.

If the automatic pass missed data because you opened a v1.8.1+ CLI/desktop build
before the old paths were available, run `/migrate` from an interactive session.
The command is available only in Go-based Reasonix builds that include it; if you
see `unknown command`, upgrade first. It prints progress while it checks legacy
config and credentials, scans legacy memory and session directories, imports
memory files and sessions that were not previously imported, and summarizes the
result. `/migrate` keeps the same safety rules as startup migration: it does not
overwrite an existing `config.toml` or memory file, it respects session import
markers, and it is not available in the legacy 0.x TypeScript line. If the old
v0.x sessions are in a custom Windows install/data directory, use
`/migrate --from "D:\OldReasonix"` to import sessions from that explicit source.

[Configuration paths](./CONFIG_PATHS.md) for the full path list and limitations.

## What's the same

The agent core carries over: the loop, tools (read/write/edit/glob/grep/bash/…),
subagents (`task`, explore/research/review), skills, hooks, plan mode, MCP client,
and DeepSeek prefix-cache–oriented design.

## What's different

- **Code intelligence**: the Go rewrite uses LSP-assisted code reading plus
  `grep` / `read_file` / `glob` for local understanding. The legacy v1 semantic
  search + tree-sitter symbol index is not bundled in v2 yet, and CodeGraph is no
  longer shipped as an internal MCP server.
- **Plan mode** + `complete_step` (evidence-backed step sign-off).
- **MCP identity and schema-cache URLs are credential-aware**: userinfo and
  credential query values (token, api_key, password, ...) no longer enter the
  host-local identity or cache fingerprints, so rotating a credential keeps
  existing trust. Receipts and caches written by earlier builds migrate
  automatically — at the pre-start identity check for eager and cache-miss
  servers, or on first evaluation otherwise — when nothing else changed; the read-only
  legacy fingerprint calculator is scheduled for removal two minor releases
  after this rollout.
- **Plan mode and permission policy are now independent**: Plan directs the
  model to plan first. Ordinary built-in and Bash calls still use the active
  Ask/Auto/YOLO rules and Sandbox, while installed MCP and proxy-resolved MCP
  writer/destructive targets plus untrusted readers stay blocked until the plan
  is approved. Explicit execution-phase tools such as `complete_step` also
  remain unavailable until plan approval. `[agent].plan_mode_allowed_tools` and
  `plan_mode_read_only_commands` are still parsed and round-tripped so old
  configs do not break, but they no longer control main Plan availability.
  Concrete MCP names in `plan_mode_allowed_tools` remain legacy local read-only
  trust aliases; prefer audited raw names in `trusted_read_only_tools` for the
  dedicated planner/read-only sub-agent registries. Use `read_only_task` /
  `read_only_skill` when a child must be technically restricted to read-only;
  ordinary `task` / `run_skill` calls remain writer-capable and permission-gated
  in Plan. Installed MCP tools use the server's `readOnlyHint` for ordinary
  permission and dispatch, but third-party hints do not grant dedicated
  planner/read-only sub-agent trust. Tools without the hint remain
  writer-classified. New optional MCP-local fields
  (`default_tools_approval_mode`, `tools.<raw>.approval_mode`, and
  `approvals_reviewer`) default to the previous behavior when absent. MCP tools
  declaring `destructiveHint: true` require a fresh human approval on every
  call — the configured reviewer is never consulted for them — and
  non-interactive sessions fail closed.
- **Read-only subagent research**: use `read_only_task` for generic isolated
  research in plan mode, or `read_only_skill` when the work should follow an
  existing skill. Both expose only read-only tools and safe foreground bash, do
  not write resumable transcripts, and keep writer-capable `task` / `run_skill`
  out of those explicitly read-only child registries. Ordinary writer-capable
  delegation in Plan uses Permissions/Sandbox.
- **No web dashboard** — the v2 line is terminal + desktop (Wails), by design.
- Some granular v1 tools are intentionally consolidated (e.g. file-management ops
  go through `bash`); a few v1 tools are not yet ported (tracked on Discussions).

## File encoding

Reasonix 1.0 supports reading and editing files in UTF-8, UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16
LE/BE, and GB18030 (a superset of GBK). This matches v1's behavior.

- `read_file` decodes any supported encoding to UTF-8 for the model.
- `edit_file` and `multi_edit` preserve the file's original encoding — if you
  edit a GB18030 file, it stays GB18030 on disk.
- `write_file` always writes UTF-8 (the model's output encoding).
- `grep` decodes before matching, so regex patterns work on non-UTF-8 files.

## Reporting issues

Issues and PRs are labelled by line: **`v1`** (legacy TypeScript) and **`v2`**
(Go). File new reports against the line you're using. The legacy `v1` line is in
maintenance mode — bug fixes only, no new features.
