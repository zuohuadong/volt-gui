// userEditMu serializes in-process read-modify-write cycles on the user config
// file. LoadForEdit+SaveTo is not atomic: two concurrent editors each load,
// mutate their own copy, and save — the second save silently drops the first
// writer's fields (e.g. bot auto-session mappings vs. a settings-page save).
// Cross-process writers still race. Every runtime in-process editor takes this
// lock around its load→mutate→save cycle: bot mapping/pairing persistence,
// desktop settings and MCP writers, serve effort switches, controller skill
// toggles, and the CLI TUI / `voltui config` write paths. Two writers stay
// unlocked on purpose: the single-threaded `voltui setup` wizard (an
// interactive whole-file write with no concurrent editors in that process)
// and the one-shot legacy-migration saves inside desktop's read-only config
// loads (tray/view paths), which only fire on first launch.

// LockUserConfigEdits acquires the process-wide user-config edit lock and
// returns the unlock. Hold it across the full LoadForEdit→mutate→SaveTo
// cycle; do not hold it across controller rebuilds or other slow non-config
// work, and never call another LockUserConfigEdits taker while holding it.
