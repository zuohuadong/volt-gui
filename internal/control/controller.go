// Package control is the transport-agnostic session driver. A Controller owns
// the agent run loop and session lifecycle, takes commands (Send/Cancel/Approve/
// SetPlanMode/Compact/NewSession/…), and emits everything that happens —
// reasoning, tool calls, approvals, turn completion — as a typed event stream to
// a single event.Sink.
//
// The point is one orchestration layer behind every frontend: a terminal TUI, a
// desktop webview, or an HTTP/SSE server each drive the Controller identically
// (issue commands, render events) and none of them re-implement turn lifecycle,
// cancellation, or approval. The Controller depends on no frontend.
