// only records candidate state, and the real FSM transition happens after the
// turn ends, once Delivery readiness and budget checks pass. It is a host
// workflow operation — it never requires write approval and grants no
// permissions. Outside an active goal turn it fails closed without changing
// any state, so plain chat cannot be hijacked into goal machinery.

The host validates your claim against Delivery acceptance criteria and decides whether to continue automatically. Fields: `status` (required, one of continue|complete|blocked), `reason` (required for continue and blocked, optional for complete), `next_action` (optional concrete next step; recommended for continue)."
